we completed the process of creating CI/CD Pipeline for Java and .NET Core Runtimes on Kubernetes. 
The work is carried out end-to-end installation, configuration and management of the CI/CD process with container orchestration. 
Eight different flows have been completed on Jenkins and Gitlab and CI/CD.

CI/CD on jenkins
